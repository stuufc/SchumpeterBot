**Project description:**

The main functionality of the bot is to convert a user input into “Yoda language”. In the context of this project, Yoda Language is understood as a language that corresponds to the peculiar sentence structure of Jedi Master Yoda from the Star Wars films. 
This means that a Discord user can enter any given sentence and the bot converts this sentence into Yoda language.  

Building on this main functionality the bot contains two game modes. The first game mode is called “Whose quote is this?”. The goal of this game mode is that the user shall guess what character from the Star Wars movies said a certain quote. 
The trick in this game is that the quote has been converted to the Yoda language by the bot. Points are awarded if the user guesses the correct character If the user uses a hint, only half a point is awarded. 
The hint provides more context and states in what movie this quote was said. 
The second game mode, “Translate it yourself!”, presents a quote to the user, which he or she must then translate into Yoda language. In comparison to game mode 1, in this game no points are awarded. 

With the game modes, and the points that can be earned, the team hopes that competition will lead to an increased use of the bot. 
Also, the bot shall be a fun way of testing the Star Wars knowledge of the users. Additionally, the bot could be a way to entry to the Star Wars universe for people that are not familiar with the movies.
